# EPL Memory Game

![EPL Memory Game](/public/images/thumbnail.jpg)

## Technology

This app was built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) & [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/)

## Concept

A memory game where the user tries to select as many teams as they can without choosing any team more than once. After each attempt, the images are shuffled and the user tries again. The user's score & high score are updated accordingly, and a message is displayed to show success or failure.

## Motivation

This game was used as a way to improve my React skills and begin using styled-components. I thought using the teams in the [English Premier League](https://www.premierleague.com/) would provide a good challenge for anyone that plays the game due the to the number of teams and the similarity in many of the colors & logos.

## Design Process

I was provided an example of a finished product as a starting place, but all the code in this version is my own. To make the game feel more authentic, I chose to use the same color scheme as the Official EPL website. Each of the team logos is populated from an array of objects. As new teams are added/removed from the EPL each season, I can easily update this array of objects with the current teams.

## Future Development

- Add animations. I would like to add animations to the game to provide more feedback to the user when they get an answer correct or incorrect.

## Known Issues

- None known so far. As you discover issues, please report them!
